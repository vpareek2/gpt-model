# Veer's Large Language Model

Welcome to the repository for a basic Large Language Model (LLM) developed predominantly using PyTorch.

## üß† About the Project

This project is an embodiment of my learning journey into the world of Large Language Models and their implementation using deep learning libraries like PyTorch. After a lot of learning I thought it would be best to see what I could do with implementation. 

### üìö Resources and Inspirations

Throughout this journey, several resources have substantially contributed to shaping my understanding and implementation:
- **Courses:** DeepLearning.ai's [Generative AI with LLMs]([https://www.deeplearning.ai/](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/)).
- **Papers:**
  - [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
  - [Language Models are Few Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)
  - [QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) 
  - [A Survey of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223)
- **YouTube:**
  - [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfv6JckQP6U) by Andrej Karpathy.
  - [Create a Large Language Model from Scratch with Python ‚Äì Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU1WVnMk4E8) by FreeCodeCamp and Elliot Arledge.

**Note**: This project is primarily for learning purposes, and as such, you will find exhaustive comments throughout the code to elucidate the functioning and implementation details.

## üíª Code Structure

The code is structured into different many different modules, split up by part of the transformer model.

## üõ† To-Do

There's a panoply of expansions and optimizations pending due to the time constraints under which this project was wrapped up. Below are some envisaged future developments:

- [ ] Fix the chatbot functionality, the current file is an implementation from Elliot Arledge. 
- [ ] Develop a frontend, most likely using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/).
- [ ] Fine-tuning of the model for comprehension and understandability.
- [ ] Implement Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) / Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF).
